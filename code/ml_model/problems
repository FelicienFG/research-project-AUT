not learning / same results problem :
- model layers problem (too many gcn layers, not good activation funcion) --> tried and nope 
- maybe normalize nb of neighbours ? --> not enough, actually counter-productive
- maybe try having a more stable dataset like the same number of tasks ? --> still not enough, althgough sometimes slightly better
- maybe try having more diverse features ?  --> ok what features ?
- maybe all three above ? --> nope normalizing nb of neighbours not good
