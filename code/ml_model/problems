not learning / same results problem :
- model layers problem (too many gcn layers, not good activation funcion) --> tried and nope 
- maybe normalize nb of neighbours ?
- maybe try having a more stable dataset --> same number of tasks ?
- maybe try having more diverse features ?
- maybe all three above ?
