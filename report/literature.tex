\subsection{Systematic Literature Review process}

The SLR process~\cite{kitchenham2009systematic}.

\paraheading{\textbf{Scoping}}
The following research questions were used to conduct this SLR. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item RQ1
    \item RQ2
\end{itemize}
Extant literature does not sufficiently answer this question (provide a summary of current secondary studies).

\paraheading{\textbf{Planning} involved breaking down the RQs into individual search terms.} We identified the following search terms (concepts) which were combined in the following way. Some practice search runs were used to ensure that the search terms were correct and yielded correct results.
Preliminary inclusion and exclusion criteria were ....

\paraheading{It was decided that search results would be recorded by the use of ... (provide details)}.

\paraheading{\textbf{Searching}}

\paraheading{Searching was conducted on the following databases, and XYZ number of results were returned.} 

\paraheading{\textbf{Screening and Eligibility}}
Prune the list to identify the final list (max 20 papers). 

\subsection{Findings of the Literature Review}

\paraheading{The works reviewed were compared on the following metrics.} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Metric 1}: justification
    \item \textbf{Metric 2}: justification
    \item $\ldots$ (add as many as needed)
\end{itemize}

A comparison of the works was carried out and the overall results are illustrated in Table~\ref{tab:slrtable}.
