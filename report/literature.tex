\subsection{Systematic Literature Review process}

This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) aims at tackling RQ1 and RQ2. More precisely, the following research questions will be answered:

\begin{itemize}
    \item [RQ1] What is the current state-of-the-Art for DAG tasks scheduling ?        
    \item [RQ2] What machine learning  techniques are used for DAG task scheduling ?
\end{itemize}
It will also be shown how the literature doesn't provide 
a complete answer to RQ3, hence the contributions of this paper.\\

From these research questions, several concepts have been isolated,
namely, time-triggered or DAG tasks, the nature of the system (real-time multicore system),
the scheduling of tasks, and machine learning.
The recording of the search results were done using the BibTeX LateX plugin
combined with the google scholar "cite" feature.

Searching was conducted using the IEEE database.
According to the concepts identified above, 
the keyword chain used for searching is
"("real-time" OR "real time") AND 
"system" AND ("time-triggered" OR "time triggered" OR "DAG" OR "Directed Acyclic Graph" OR "event chain" OR "event-chain") 
AND "task" 
AND ("scheduling" OR "scheduler" OR "schedule") 
AND ("multi-processors" OR "multi-cores" OR "multi processors" OR 
"multi cores" OR "multi-processor" OR "multi processor" OR 
"multi-core" OR "multi core")".
%             EC1    EC2    EC3
%1,259 -> 515 -> 403 -> 101 -> 19 --> 17
The search produced 1,259 results on the IEEE database
which was reduced to 515 papers when considering only 
articles published in the past 5 years.

Then the following exclusion criterias (ECs) were used to filter out 
the rest of the articles, bringing the final number of papers down to 17
(see Figure \ref{fig:slr_process}).

\subsection{Findings of the Literature Review}

\subsubsection{Non-Machine Learning techniques}
~


\citet{guan2021DAGfluid} 
use fluid scheduling to schedule multiple DAG tasks
on a multicore system. 
Fluid scheduling has been used in previous work for independent
time-triggered task scheduling\cite{baruah1993PFair}\cite{cho2006LLREF} 
but very few consider DAG tasks. Fluid-scheduling is known for producing optimal scheduling algorithms.
Their method decomposes a DAG task into several sequential segments
in which the subtasks will execute according to the fluid scheduling 
model. Although their algorithm significantly outperforms
existing algorithms, the main limitation that is common to all fluid-based
scheduling algorithm is the runtime overhead induced by the fluid-scheduling model.
Although authors in \cite{guan2021DAGfluid} briefly explain how 
to transform their scheduling algorithm to a non-fluid one for practical implementation,
they do not evaluate the overhead caused by the frequent task migrations
and preemptions. This overhead can lead to deadline misses
on systems where the migration cost is high which is why it is important,
especially with fluid-based algorithms, to consider this overhead\cite{migrationCostFairSched}.
 Also, their algorithm only considers DAG task with implicit deadlines
(D = T) which makes the response-time analysis simpler but to the cost
of not covering all types of tasks that can execute on real-time systems.

As a follow up, \citet{GuanFluidDag2022} 
extend the fluid scheduling algorithm in \cite{guan2021DAGfluid}
to constrained and arbitrary deadline tasks,
especially focusing on DAG tasks with a deadline greater than their period,
thus generalizing their previous fluid algorithm
to all types of periodic tasks.
Their main contributions are their new scheduling algorithm that 
performs better than existing methods in terms of acceptance ratio,
and producing the first theoretical capacity bound for DAG tasks
with deadlines greater than their periods.
However, the authors still don't provide any evaluation 
on the amount of runtime overhead their scheduling algorithm implementation
produces which generally lowers the actual acceptance ratio
of the algorithm. 

Instead of considering fluid-scheduling,
a popular scheduling method is federated scheduling.
Federated scheduling is based on the idea
of assigning heavy tasks ($U > 1$) to multiple cores
for the whole duration of the tasks' executions,
and assigning light tasks ($U \le 1$) to execute on
cores that had no heavy task assigned to them.
Although it is popular, it suffers from a resource wasting problem,
especially when the difference between the critical path's length 
and the deadline is small,
which many papers aim at solving
\cite{Guan2023FederatedNew}
\cite{jiangUtilTensityBound}
\cite{JiangVirtuallyFederatedSched2021}
\cite{Jiang2023SchedVirtualProcs}
\cite{Kobayashi2023FedBundledDagsched}
\cite{He2023DegreeOfParallelism}.

\citet{jiangUtilTensityBound}, for instance, 
consider federated scheduling and Global EDF,
and introduce an enhanced metric called the util-tensity bound
that extends the concept of capacity bound
to have a better schedulability test.
Based on this newly derived bound, the authors 
propose an extension to the classic federated algorithm,
with very low tensity tasks being scheduled with Global EDF(GEDF), 
tasks with high-utilization and relatively high tensities are scheduled
using the classic federated scheduling and low utilization
tasks with relatively high tensities are scheduled using partitioned-EDF.
Their algorithm, based on their newly derived bound, effectively improves
the system schedulability of DAG tasks and reduces the resource wasting 
problem of federated scheduling. The main limitation
of this paper is that they only consider GEDF 
for their util-tensity bound and
don't compare with using other algorithms such as Global RM.
Also, they only consider implicit deadline DAG tasks
which doesn't represent tasks that need to have a deadline 
lower than their period.

This problem of resource wasting in federated scheduling
is also tackled by \citet{Kobayashi2023FedBundledDagsched}
where they propose a federated and bundled-based scheduling
algorithm which enhances the schedulability of DAG tasks
compared to existing federated scheduling algorithms.
Their method consists of using federated scheduling for
tasks with high critical path to deadline ratio and bundled
scheduling for tasks with low critical path to deadline ratio.
Unfortunately, they only look at 3 DAG tasks to evaluate
their algorithm which is a really small amount and is not 
representative of the different DAG tasks that can exist
which leaves space for observational bias.

\citet{JiangVirtuallyFederatedSched2021}
take another approach by proposing a virtually-federated 
scheduling algorithm that leverages the advantages
of federated scheduling while improving the acceptance 
ratio for DAG tasks, outperforming existing algorithms.
Their approach consists of adding a virtual layer
of processors, on top of physical processors,
and apply their federated-based scheduling algorithm on those virtual processors,
thus enabling tasks to share a physical processor
even though they are assigned to different virtual processors.
The main drawback in \cite{JiangVirtuallyFederatedSched2021}
is that the authors only consider the heavy tasks (i.e., $U > 1$)
and do not take the light tasks into account,
meaning it doesn't consider tasks that only need 
one processor to execute.

To fix this limitation, \citet{Jiang2023SchedVirtualProcs}
extend their previous work\cite{JiangVirtuallyFederatedSched2021}
so that it considers both heavy and light tasks.
The resulting virtually federated scheduling algorithm
clearly outperforms any other federated-based scheduling algorithms
in terms of acceptance ratio.
However, they still only consider implicit or constrained deadline tasks
and they don't provide any evaluation of the run time overhead 
their algorithm might induce, to compare with algorithms currently used
in real-time systems, such as GEDF.


\citet{Guan2023FederatedNew} 
consider arbitrary deadline tasks and especially
DAG tasks that have a deadline that is greater than their period.
They introduce a new federated scheduling algorithm 
that takes this type of tasks into account 
and compare it to existing global or federated scheduling approaches
for arbitrary deadline tasks, significantly outperforming
most of them in terms of acceptance ratio.
Their approach consists of using this new proposed aglgorithm 
for heavy tasks that have a deadline bigger than their period,
then using classic federated scheduling for the heavy tasks with a 
constrained deadline, and finally using EDF-First-Fit (EDF-FF) for the light tasks.
Although the fluid-based method in \cite{GuanFluidDag2022}
outperforms this new federated scheduling algorithm,
the impracticality of fluid-based algorithm makes this algorithm
the current best, in terms of acceptance ratio, for dealing with arbitrary
deadlines. The main limitation of this work 
is that it doesn't tackle the resource wasting problem 
that classical federated scheduling, or their new algorithm, has or can potentially have, but only
focuses on providing an algorithm for arbitrary deadline tasks.

For constrained deadline DAG tasks, 
\citet{He2023DegreeOfParallelism} propose a federated-based
scheduling algorithm that outperforms on average by more than 18\%
previous State-Of-The-Art\cite{Jiang2023SchedVirtualProcs} (SOTA) in terms of acceptance
ratio, making this work the current SOTA for constrained deadline multi-DAG scheduling.
Their approach uses the notion of degree of parallelism, which they 
define rigorously, to improve the classic federated scheduling way of 
choosing the number of cores to assign each heavy tasks to.
They also propose a new response-time bound for constrained deadline DAG tasks
based on this defined notion.
Although their method clearly stands out,
they don't consider intra-task scheduling at all 
when their motivation came from the notion 
of degree of parallelism being used
but wrongly defined in previous intra-task scheduling work\cite{Zhao2022DAGsched}\cite{zhao2020DAGsched}.\\

Federated scheduling isn't the only method used,
\citet{JiangDecompoSchedParallelTask},
for instance, propose a decomposition-based 
approach to schedule multiple DAG tasks as well as 
a metric for testing the schedulability of tasks.
Their decomposition strategy proves to be the most efficient 
, according to the defined metric, and the scheduling algorithm
derived from it shows promising results in terms of
acceptance ratio.
Their decomposition strategy basically works by first 
defining execution segments and then assigning subtasks 
to those segments using the laxity\footnote{Laxity is the gap between the total execution time of a task (potentially including the I/O delays) and its deadline.} of those subtasks so that 
no segment is overloaded with workload.
The main limitation of this work is that 
they only look at GEDF variants for priority assignment 
and do not evaluate their decomposition method
using other scheduling heuristics for multi-DAGs.

Most of the articles presented up to now 
tackle inter-task scheduling, not considering
the intra-task execution schedule.
Indeed, intra-task scheduling\cite{He2019DagIntra}\cite{Xiao2019}
\cite{Shi2024DagExecGroups}\cite{Zhao2024GATDRLmodel}\cite{Lee2021GlobalDagSchedDRL}
\cite{GuanFRTDS2020RL} is often tackled as a separate
problem due to the dependency constraints.

\citet{Xiao2019}, for instance, introduce a scheduling algorithm 
, 'MAS', that shortens the makespan of periodic DAG tasks
compared to the classic EDF dynamic priorty scheduling technique.
Their algorithm is based on a clustering approach, combined with
a technique called task duplication, and they evaluate their method
on an actual simulation object for real-time scheduling.
Unfortunately, their evaluation is only based on a single DAG task
and they only compare their algorithm with EDF.
Their algorithm also shows a scalability problem compared to 
other existing algorithms with comparable results.

A scalable way of scheduling sub-tasks of a DAG 
is looking at priority-list scheduling
which \citet{He2019DagIntra} use to propose 
an algorithm that effectively outperforms
other intra-task DAG scheduling algorithms
in terms of makespan.
Their priority assignment algorithm
is based on the length of the paths passing through each vertex.
The longer the maximum length, the higher the priority.
This effectively takes advantage of the inner graph structure
to optimize the intra-task execution order,
which is something that hasn't been done before this work.
Although the authors compare their results with existing
scheduling heuristics, they do not consider 
the, mathematically optimal, ILP method to compare
their makespan results with the mathematically minimum makespan.

This priority-list scheduling approach is also 
used by \citet{Zhao2022DAGsched}, extending their previous work\cite{zhao2020DAGsched}
which developed a priority assignment based on 
the critical-path execution first (CPEF) concept,
effectively outperforming \citet{He2019DagIntra}
in terms of makespan and providing 
a federated-based multi-DAG scheduling algorithm,
compatible with this new priority-list scheduling algorithm.
Their multi-DAG scheduling algorithms also outpeforms 
the multi-DAG algorithm used in \cite{He2019DagIntra}.
Their method uses the vertices in the critical path 
as producers of workload for the parallelizable vertices
to consume.
For multi-DAG they look at assigning processors
to DAG tasks, like in federated scheduling, using 
a parallelism-aware workload distribution model
that uses their Concurrent Producer Consumer (CPC) model
to assign cores while minimizing the inter-task workload interference.
One limitation of their work is that,
although they consider constrained deadlines for the response-time
analysis, they only use implicit deadline DAG tasks 
for evaluating the system schedulability of their multi-DAG 
scheduling algorithm.\\


Those intra-task scheduling papers only consider the theoretical
makespan when task migration and preemption 
is instantaneous, and don't take the runtime overhead into account.
One major factor in the runtime overhead is the communication 
delays between each subtasks of a DAG task, which are rarely considered.
To that end, \citet{Shi2024DagExecGroups}
propose an extension of the DAG task model to add 
execution groups that bind groups of subtasks
to a single physical core, thus reducing 
inter-core communication which can cause major
communication delays depending on the topolgy of the system.
They also introduce a scheduling algorithm 
and compare the makespan of their approach to existing methods
such as federated scheduling and critical path-based scheduling.
Their method shows comparable results while minimizing 
the communication overheads.
However, the evaluation is only done on 100 generated 
DAG tasks which is a small sample size compared to the other papers\cite{Zhao2022DAGsched}\cite{He2019DagIntra},
exposing the experiment to observational biases.
Furthermore, although they introduce a way to extend their approach to schedule
multiple DAGs, they do not provide any evaluation of that.


\subsubsection{Machine Learning techniques}
~

Only a few papers consider machine learning 
to address the DAG task scheduling problem.

\citet{Lee2021GlobalDagSchedDRL}, for instance,
design a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model called GoSu 
which takes a DAG task as input and outputs 
a priority list of the DAG's nodes.
The resulting makespan, on a non-preemptive, global fixed-piority scheduler, is 
then compared to the results in \cite{Zhao2022DAGsched} and \cite{He2019DagIntra}
and the DRL model proposed in \cite{Lee2021GlobalDagSchedDRL}
outperforms them by up to 3\%.
The model is comprised of a graph convolutional network 
layer to encode the graph structure information,
and a sequential decoder layer based on the attention-mechanism,
which produces a priority list of the vertices.
The reinforcement learning process uses the makespan as the reward to minimize
and the REINFORCE algorithm is used to find the best policy.
Although the time it takes for the model to run is measured,
no comparison with the ILP method is done and 
there is no evaluation of the scalability of the model 
when increasing the amount of cores in the system or the amount of nodes in a DAG task.
However, \citet{Lee2021GlobalDagSchedDRL} isn't the only work considering 
DRL as a method for DAG intra-task scheduling.

Indeed, \citet{Zhao2024GATDRLmodel} also 
use the DRL approach to tackle the intra-task scheduling 
problem and compare their results to the makespan
obtained by solving the equivalent ILP problem.
Their model achieves up to 75\% of makespan 
reduction compared to ILP, that is, the makespan 
produced by the ILP method is, on average, 25\% smaller than the 
makespan produced by their DRL model,
which is a relatively good performance as 
the ILP approach gives the mathematically minimum makespan.
The more important result, however,
is that when you increase the subtasks in the DAG tasks,
the ILP method explodes in terms of computing
time when the DRL approach gives a result in a relativley short time,
making it scalable, unlike the ILP approach.
The model uses a combination of a graph neural network 
with attention layers to better capture 
the structure and dependency information of the DAG task.
The makespan is also used for the reward function but 
a Soft Actor Critic algorithm is used to train the model. 
Unfortunately, the paper doesn't provide 
an evaluation when increasing the number of cores 
in the system and also doesn't compare their model 
to SOTA heuristics, which also aim to approximate 
the optimal solution given by the ILP method.

\citet{GuanFRTDS2020RL} focus more on optimizing
communication delays by looking 
at the real-time simulation system FRTDS
and using the I/O usage and ram allocation to construct a cost 
function, which is then used as a reward for their proposed
DRL model to schedule DAG's subtasks.
The cost is divided into a current cost, what we know,
and the future cost which is predicted using the subtask's successors.
The model performs better, in terms of makespan, than 
existing scheduling algorithms implemented on the FRTDS platform 
but because of the RL process accumulating the previous subtask's
execution as experience to learn, the method uses a lot of memory
which affects the speed of execution.

         introducing the first capacity bound for deadlines longer than periods. It outperforms SOTA in acceptance ratio (as of 2022). & As for every fluid scheduling based algorithm
        the issue of runtime overhead is not 
        entirely considered as they don't evaluate this metric. & They first decompose each DAG task
        into segments of sequential tasks and then assign execution rates
        to each tasks or threads. Those two steps aim 
        at producing a fluid schedule so that it appears as though each DAG task
        is continuously running on the cores. \\

        \cite{GuanFRTDS2020RL} & Most scheduling algorithm that consider
        resource use consider it as constraints rather than considering them 
        as part of the scheduling decision process. & Propose a DRL-based algorithm for task scheduling on the FRTDS simulation system, outperforming
         existing algorithms in makespan for single DAG tasks. & The reinforcement learning 
        algorithm uses the previous tasks' execution as experience
        which implies a lot of memory usage,
        thus affecting the speed of execution. & They use I/O and RAM allocation to create a cost function as the RL reward, combining current 
        costs with future costs predicted from successor subtasks. \\

        \cite{JiangVirtuallyFederatedSched2021} & Federated scheduling 
        has shown great potential for scheduling DAG tasks but 
        suffers from a resource wasting problem which has 
        been addressed but to a limited extent. & Propose a virtually-federated scheduling algorithm that reduces 
        resource wastage while maintaining federated scheduling's benefits, and outperforms existing algorithms in acceptance ratio. 
        & Only consider heavy tasks and constrained deadline DAG tasks. 
        & Introduce Active and Passive VPs per core. Active VPs handle primary 
        tasks and use excess capacity for 
        Passive VPs. Allocation is based on deadlines, critical path length, and task usefulness.\\

According to these findings,
the current state-of-the-Art for DAG task scheduling (RQ1)
seems to be a federated-based scheduling approach for inter-task 
scheduling and a global priority-list approach for intra-task scheduling
\cite{He2023DegreeOfParallelism}\cite{Zhao2022DAGsched}.

In terms of machine learning techniques (RQ2), every article found uses 
deep reinforcement learning for scheduling DAG tasks.
More specifically, the model proposed is often a combination
of a kind of graph neural network and attention layers 
to produce a priority-list of the subtasks of the DAG task.

Multiple limitations were found for each 
paper. Notably, the type of task that is 
considered which mostly is constrained or implicit deadline tasks,
and arbitrary tasks are rarely considered due to the complexity they add
to the scheduling analysis.
Also, there hasn't been any use of supervise machine learning 
for real-time task scheduling
and no paper looked at comparing its method to both the ILP approach and SOTA heuristics.
